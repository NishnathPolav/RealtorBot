# Automatic Property Listing Creation via Watsonx Assistant

## Overview

The RealtorBot now supports automatic property listing creation through natural conversation with the Watsonx Assistant. Sellers can simply chat with the AI assistant to provide property details, and the system will automatically create a listing once all required information is collected.

## How It Works

### 1. Conversation Flow
- Seller starts a conversation with the AI assistant
- Assistant asks for property details (title, address, price, etc.)
- System tracks collected information in real-time
- When all required fields are complete, a confirmation dialog appears

### 2. Required Fields
The system requires the following information to create a listing:
- **Property Title**: Name/type of the property
- **Street Address**: Full street address
- **City**: City name
- **State**: State abbreviation (e.g., CA, NY, TX)
- **Zip Code**: 5-digit zip code
- **Price**: Property price (can include currency symbols)

### 3. Optional Fields
- **Description**: Detailed property description

### 4. User Experience

#### Step 1: Start Conversation
```
User: "I want to list my property"
Assistant: "I'd be happy to help you create a property listing! Let me gather some information about your property. What type of property are you listing?"
```

#### Step 2: Collect Information
```
User: "It's a 3-bedroom house"
Assistant: "Great! A 3-bedroom house. What's the street address?"
User: "123 Main Street"
Assistant: "123 Main Street. What city is this located in?"
User: "San Francisco"
Assistant: "San Francisco. What state?"
User: "California"
Assistant: "California. What's the zip code?"
User: "94102"
Assistant: "94102. And what's the asking price?"
User: "$850,000"
```

#### Step 3: Confirmation Dialog
Once all required information is collected, the system displays a confirmation dialog showing:
- All collected property information
- Option to confirm or cancel
- Loading state during creation

#### Step 4: Success Feedback
After successful creation:
- Success message in chat
- Property appears in seller dashboard
- Option to view the listing

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend (Chat.jsx)

### Backend (assistant.js)
- **Context Processing**: Extracts property variables from assistant context
- **Validation**: Ensures all required fields are present
- **Database Integration**: Creates listing in Watsonx Discovery
- **Action Handling**: Processes `create_listing` actions

### Key Features
1. **Real-time Tracking**: Property information is collected as the conversation progresses
2. **Smart Validation**: Only shows confirmation when all required fields are complete
3. **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean confirmation dialog with all collected information

## Usage Instructions

### For Sellers

2. Start a conversation with the AI assistant
3. Provide property details when prompted
4. Review the confirmation dialog
5. Click "Create Listing" to save the property

### Example Conversation
```
User: "I want to list my property"
Assistant: "I'd be happy to help you create a property listing! Let me gather some information about your property. What type of property are you listing?"

User: "It's a 2-bedroom apartment"
Assistant: "Great! A 2-bedroom apartment. What's the street address?"

User: "456 Oak Avenue"
Assistant: "456 Oak Avenue. What city is this located in?"

User: "Los Angeles"
Assistant: "Los Angeles. What state?"

Assistant: "90210. And what's the asking price?"

User: "$650,000"
Assistant: "Perfect! I have all the information I need. Let me show you a summary of your property listing for your review."

[Confirmation dialog appears with all collected information]
```

## Error Handling

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Required Fields**: System will continue conversation until all fields are provided
2. **Invalid Price Format**: System automatically cleans currency symbols and commas
3. **Network Errors**: Graceful error messages with retry options
4. **Authentication Issues**: Redirects to login if session expires

### Fallback Options
- Manual form creation via "Add Listing" page
- Retry functionality in confirmation dialog
- Clear error messages with actionable guidance
